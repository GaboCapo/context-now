## Project Management

`context-now` is designed to manage multiple projects simultaneously.

### Connect a Project
To add a new project, use the `-c` or `--connect` command:
```bash
# Provide the path to your Git project
cn -c /path/to/your/project
```
The tool will then create the necessary symlinks and configuration files.

### List Projects
Display all connected projects:
```bash
cn -l
# Or
cn --list
```

### Switch to a Project
Change the active context to another project:
```bash
# By project number (from the list)
cn -g 1

# By project name
cn -g my-project
```

### Show Project Status
The status command is the most important command. It gives you an overview of the current state of your project.
```bash
# Shows the status of the current project
cn -s

# Shows the status of a specific project
cn -s my-project
```
In a project directory, you can also use the `npm` scripts if they are set up:
```bash
npm run context-now
```

### Disconnect a Project
Remove a project from management:
```bash
cn -d my-project
```

---

## Typical Workflow

1.  **Connect a project**:
    `cn -c ~/Code/my-project`

2.  **Change into the project directory**:
    `cd ~/Code/my-project`

3.  **Check status**:
    `npm run context-now` or `cn -s`

4.  **Edit JSON files**:
    Keep `issues.json` and other files up to date.
    `vim tools/context-tracker/issues.json`

5.  **Synchronize**:
    After `git` operations like `pull` or `checkout`, you should synchronize the status:
    `npm run context-now:sync` or `cn sync`

## Maintaining JSON Files

The accuracy of the tool depends on the timeliness of the project-specific JSON files. These are located in the `tools/context-tracker` directory of your project.

- **`issues.json`**:
  A list of issues, ideally with status, priority, and labels.
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "#123",
      "title": "Implement feature",
      "status": "open",
      "priority": "high",
      "labels": ["feature", "frontend"]
    }
  ]
  ```

- **`github-branches.json`**:
  An up-to-date list of branches that exist on GitHub. This is important because `git` has local caches of remote branches that can become outdated.

- **`project-memory.json`**:
  Links branches to issues and stores metadata such as the creation date.

- **`issue-relations.json`** (optional):
  Defines relationships between issues (e.g., epics) to enable smarter recommendations.
  ```json
  {
    "#100": {
      "type": "epic",
      "includes": ["#101", "#102", "#103"]
    }
  }
  ```

## Team Collaboration

The `handover` command was specifically designed for handing over work to teammates.
```bash
# Run this command in your project directory
cn handover
```
**Output:**
- Uncommitted changes (`git status`)
- The last commit
- Unfinished work (based on the comparison of branches and issues)
- Next steps (recommendations from the tool)

This gives your teammate a quick and comprehensive overview of the current state of your work.
